<!-- HTML Table Challenge
    This is considered a nested table. By taking an already made table that
    contains two rows with four total cells, we are able to take that and place
    a table in a cell. This is what nesting is. You take the table that exists
    and place it in a singular cell, giving the impressions that you can fit
    and structure four items in a column, but really you're just placing all
    the data in one area (cell). This is usually not done with html tables
    because the styling is usually left to CSS. However, this gives a better
    understanding of how to utilize tables in html. -->
